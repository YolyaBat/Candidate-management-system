## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create a .env file and populate it with the environmental variables from the doc you provided** (an example is in the .env.example file)
3. **Run**
  ```bash
   npm run dev
```

## A small note 📘: 

- The request fails with a CORS error, so I added a workaround: the request is sent through a proxy, not via a browser. So, I carefully added a couple of TODOs in the code to remove it when the CORS issue is resolved (in an imaginary future) ✨

I'm looking forward very much to your feedback! 

For sure, my styling and structuring preferences might not match yours 100%, so I'm very open to feedback, growth, and learning new coding practices every day ☀️

Kind regards,
Yulia
